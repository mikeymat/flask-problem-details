# flask-problem-details
This module enhances Flask applications using Flask OpenAPI and Pydantic by introducing structured error handling based on the [RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807). It supports automatic validation error handling and provides detailed error responses, optionally including stack traces.
